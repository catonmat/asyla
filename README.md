# 1.BACKGROUND
Once a refugee arrives in their host country they face a multitude of issues that often prevent successful integration. Losing an important document or missing a meeting can jeopardiaze their right to work and can lead them to lose their right to work or access to key resources. To make things worse, their case managers are overworked and often lack the time and resources to offer the personal guidance to help minimize these negative outcomes from occuring.

Asyla is a product that intends to address the communication gap existing between refugee resettlement agencies and the refugees they represent. It is a task management system that provides a centralised repository of client information for case managers that help them automate key workflows and improve their productivity. It's also a progress tracker and personal-assistant for refugees to help them meet core integration milestones and feel more in control of their own life rather than a cog in the bureacratic machine.

# 2. Next Steps
The code presented here is an MVP in its first iteration built in less than two weeks.

V.1.0 will include a resdesign from the grounds-up including:
- React frontend
- React Native for client-side views
- Integrated Testing (end-to-end testing)

The MVP is hosted on Heroku at: www.asyla.ca
